This initial Maven code structure was created using the **maven-archetype-quickstart** archetype via the following command:

```
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example.helloworld -DartifactId=dropwizard-helloworld -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
```

The code in this repository roughly follows the [Dropwizard example](http://www.dropwizard.io/0.9.2/docs/getting-started.html) code on-line.

**Dropwizard** is an example of an embedded container application server. In traditonal **Application Server** contexts, you start your server and deploy your compiled application into it. In an **embedded container** context, you embed a lightweight container, in this case **Jetty** with your application.

**Dropwizard** is a lightweight framework that uses *Jetty* for *HTTP*, *Jersey* for *REST* and *Jackson* for *JSON*. It is everything you need to deploy a simple REST-based Web Service.

A quick overview of the code:

* *Configuration Class* - *HelloWorldConfiguration* is a subclass of *Configuration* which specifies environment-specific parameters. These parameters are housed in a **YAML** configuration file called *hello-world.yaml*. *Jackson* does the magic to map contents from the *yaml* file back and forth into the Java world.
* *Application Class* - *HelloWorldApplication* is a sublcass of *Application* (the core of the Dropwizard application) and is parametrized with *HelloWorldConfiguration*.
* *Representation Class* -  in short, a *JSON* representation needs to conform to [RFC 1149](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1149.txt) which specifies that things should look like the following. *Saying* provides the representation of this response.
```
{
  "id": 1,
  "content": "Hi!"
}
```
* *Resource Class* - Jersey resources are the building blocks of Dropwizard applications. Each resource class maps to a **URI** template. In this example, we return new *Saying*s from the */hello-world* URI. This resource needs to be registered with the application. See the *run* method of *HelloWorldApplication*.

A quick note, I am omitting a **Health Check** in this applcation, so you may see an ugly warning when running this application. This is innoquous.

Dropwizard applications are typically built as **fat** jars using the **maven-shade** plug-in. This is essentially a self-contained jar - app code + dependency code - that can be dropped somewhere and run. This type of logic will produce a dependency-reduced pom so, if and when, the app and pom are published, this will provide a different view of how to build vs how to consume this application. Some other magic happens here like stripping digital signatures, collating service manifest data and setting the *MainClass* to be run when the application is started via *java -jar*.

To build the application, type:

```
mvn package
```

To run the application, type:

```
java -jar target/dropwizard-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar server hello-world.yml
```
